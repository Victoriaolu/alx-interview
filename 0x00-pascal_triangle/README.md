A pascal's triangle is an arrangement of numbers in a triangular array such that the numbers at the end of each row are 1 and the remaining numbers are the sum of the nearest two numbers in the above row. This concept is used widely in probability, combinatorics, and algebra. Pascal's triangle is used to find the likelihood of the outcome of the toss of a coin, coefficients of binomial expansions in probability, etc.

Pascals triangle or Pascal's triangle is a special triangle that is named after Blaise Pascal, in this triangle, we start with 1 at the top, then 1s at both sides of the triangle until the end. The middle numbers are so filled that each number is the sum of the two numbers just above it. The number of elements in the nth row is equal to (n + 1) elements. Pascal's triangle can be constructed by writing 1 as the first and the last element of a row and the other elements of the row are obtained from the sum of the two consecutive elements of the previous row. Pascal's triangle can be constructed easily by just adding the pair of successive numbers in the preceding lines and writing them in the new line.

Pascals triangle or Pascal's triangle is shown in the image below. Here, we can see that any number is the sum of the two numbers just above that number.

Must Know
To successfully complete this project, you should revise the following Python concepts:

Lists and List Comprehensions:

Understand how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.
Utilize list comprehensions for more concise and readable code, especially for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
Functions:

Know how to define and call functions.
Pass parameters and return values, particularly how to return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.
Loops:

Use for and while loops to iterate through sequences.
Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.
Conditional Statements:
